# Aid Distribution Dashboard – Coding Challenge

This repository contains my solution for the **Aidonic Technical Challenge**. The goal is to build a cross-platform dashboard for managing and visualizing aid distributions, using modern frontend technologies and best architectural practices.

## Architecture Overview

This project is built as a **monorepo** using pnpm workspaces, and follows a **modular feature-based architecture** with a clear separation of concerns using the Container/Presentation pattern and SOLID principles.

### Folder Structure (Web App)

```
packages/web-next/
├── public/                      → Static assets
├── src/
│   ├── app/                    → App Router layout, routing, metadata
│   ├── features/               → Domain features (e.g. Distributions, Charts)
│   │   └── distributions/
│   │       ├── components/     → Presentational UI components
│   │       ├── containers/     → Container components with business logic
│   │       ├── hooks/          → Custom hooks for fetching and state
│   │       ├── services/       → API access (mocked or real)
│   │       ├── types/          → TypeScript models
│   │       └── index.ts        → Barrel exports
│   ├── shared/                 → Reusable UI: buttons, layout, inputs
│   └── lib/                    → Utilities, constants, MSW handlers
├── .eslintrc.json
├── tailwind.config.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

The mobile app (`packages/mobile-app/`) will follow the same modular feature-based structure using React Native.

## Challenge Requirements

### Web (Next.js)

- [x] Distribution list (table with filters, pagination)
- [x] Distribution detail page
- [x] Charts page (pie + line)
- [x] Container/Presenter structure
- [x] SOLID + Clean Code principles
- [x] API mocked (MSW or json-server)

### Mobile (React Native)

- [ ] Distribution list (cards)
- [ ] Details screen (stacked)
- [ ] Pull to refresh
- [ ] Charts page (optional)

## Tech Stack

- React (18+)
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React Native (Expo)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Recharts
- Jest + RTL
- pnpm (monorepo management)

## Architecture Principles

- **Container/Presenter pattern**: separates business logic from UI rendering
- **SOLID principles**: each module has a single responsibility and is easily testable
- **Clean Code**: readable, maintainable, modular, and testable code

## Mock API (MSW)

### Endpoints

- `GET /api/distributions`
- `GET /api/distributions/:id`

### Example

```json
{
  "id": "dst--001",
  "region": "West Nile",
  "date": "2025-06-15",
  "status": "Planned",
  "beneficiaries": 1200,
  "aidType": "Food",
  "deliveryChannel": "Vouchers",
  "beneficiaryList": [
    { "id": "bnf--001", "name": "Jane Doe" },
    { "id": "bnf--002", "name": "John Smith" }
  ]
}
```

## Testing Strategy

- **Jest + React Testing Library**
- **React Native Testing Library** (for mobile UI)
- Feature-level unit tests where applicable
- Utility and service function tests

## Development Status

- Web app initialized
- Folder structure created
- Tailwind + ESLint + TypeScript configured
- Pages coming next
- Mobile app to be scaffolded

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Both Services (Recommended)

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will start:

- Mock API server on port 3002
- Web application on port 3000

### Run Services Separately

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Mock API
pnpm dev:api

# Terminal 2 - Web App
pnpm dev:web
```

## 📱 Access the Application

- **Web Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **Mock API**: http://localhost:3002/distributions

## Setup Instructions (Web)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
